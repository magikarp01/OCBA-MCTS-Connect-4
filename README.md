# OCBA-MCTS-Connect-4
A kind of working implementation of "Monte Carlo tree search with optimal computing budget allocation" on Connect 4.
To run: download the main.py and nodePrototype.py files, run the main.py file. The computer will make a move, then it'll prompt you for a move: the moves can be 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 corresponding to the column you want to place a piece in.

Right now, the program is not too intelligent. Please do not cyberbully it.

The budget doesn't work perfectly yet: for now, it is the total number of iterations of OCBATree, which isn't fully accurate especially with different depths.
